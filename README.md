# üõ†Ô∏è xcodebuild.nvim

A plugin that lets you move your iOS, iPadOS and macOS apps development to Neovim. It supports most of Xcode actions that are required to work with a project, including device selection, building, launching, and testing.

## üöß Disclaimer

This plugin is in the early stage of development. It was tested on a limited number of projects and configurations. Therefore, it still could be buggy. If you find any issue don't hesitate to fix it and create a pull request or just report it.

I've been looking for a solution to move my development to any other IDE than Xcode for a long time. It seems that this plugin + [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) + [nvim-dap-ui](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui) + [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) + [xcode-build-server](https://github.com/SolaWing/xcode-build-server), all together, provide everything that is needed to move to Neovim with iOS, iPadOS, and macOS apps development.

Of course, you will still need Xcode for some project setup & management. Also, you may need to migrate to [tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) or [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to be able to add new files easily.

It is also my first Neovim plugin. Hopefully, a good one üòÅ.

- [x] Picker with all available actions.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) (not sure which version, use the latest one üòÖ).
- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) used to present pickers by the plugin.
- [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim) used to present code coverage report.
- [xcbeautify](https://github.com/tuist/xcbeautify) - Xcode logs formatter (optional - you can set a different tool or disable formatting in the config).
- Xcode (make sure that `xcodebuild` and `xcrun simctl` work correctly).
- To get the best experience with apps development, you should install and configure [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and [nvim-dap-ui](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui) to be able to debug.
- This plugin requires the project to be written in Swift. It was tested only with Xcode 15.
- Make sure to configure LSP properly for iOS/macOS apps. You can read how to do that in my post: [The Complete Guide To iOS & macOS Development In Neovim](https://wojciechkulik.pl/ios/the-complete-guide-to-ios-macos-development-in-neovim).

Install tools:

```shell
brew install xcbeautify
```

### üîé Test File Search - File Matching

`xcodebuild` logs provide the following information about the test: target, test class, and test name. The plugin needs to find the file location based on that, which is not a trivial task.

In order to support multiple cases, the plugin allows you to choose the search mode. It offers four modes to find a test class. You can change it by setting `test_search.file_matching`.

- `filename` - it assumes that the test class name matches the file name. It finds matching files and then based on the build output, it checks whether the file belongs to the desired target.
- `lsp` - it uses LSP to find the class symbol. Each match is checked if it belongs to the desired target.
- `filename_lsp` first try `filename` mode, if it fails try `lsp` mode.
- `lsp_filename` first try `lsp` mode, if it fails try `filename` mode.

`filename_lsp` is the recommended mode, because `filename` search is faster than `lsp`, but you also have `lsp` fallback if there is no match from `filename`.

üëâ If you notice that your test results don't appear or appear in incorrect files, try playing with these modes.

üëâ If your test results don't appear, you can also try disabling `test_search.target_matching`. This way the plugin will always use the first match without checking its target.

### üì± Setup Your Neovim For iOS Development

I wrote an article that sums up all steps to set up your Neovim from scratch to develop iOS and macOS apps:

[The Complete Guide To iOS & macOS Development In Neovim](https://wojciechkulik.pl/ios/the-complete-guide-to-ios-macos-development-in-neovim)

You can also check out a sample Neovim configuration that I prepared for iOS development: [ios-dev-starter-nvim](https://github.com/wojciech-kulik/ios-dev-starter-nvim)

### üì¶ Swift Packages Development

This plugin supports only iOS and macOS applications. However, if you develop Swift Package for one of those platforms, you can easily use this plugin by creating a sample iOS/macOS project in your root directory and adding your package as a dependency.

### üî¨ DAP Integration

[nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) plugin lets you debug applications like in any other IDE. On top of that [nvim-dap-ui](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui) extension will present for you all panels with stack, breakpoints, variables, logs, etc.

To configure DAP for development:

- Download codelldb VS Code plugin from: [HERE](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/releases). For macOS use `darwin` version. Just unzip `vsix` file and set paths below.
- Install also [nvim-dap-ui](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui) for a nice GUI to debug.

  <summary>üëâ nvim-dap configuration</summary>

```lua
return {
  "mfussenegger/nvim-dap",
  dependencies = {
    "wojciech-kulik/xcodebuild.nvim"
  },
  config = function()
    local dap = require("dap")
    local xcodebuild = require("xcodebuild.dap")

    dap.configurations.swift = {
      {
        name = "iOS App Debugger",
        type = "codelldb",
        request = "attach",
        program = xcodebuild.get_program_path,
        -- alternatively, you can wait for the process manually
        -- pid = xcodebuild.wait_for_pid,
        cwd = "${workspaceFolder}",
        stopOnEntry = false,
        waitFor = true,
      },
    }

          "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Versions/A/LLDB",
        },
      },
    }

    -- disables annoying warning that requires hitting enter
    local orig_notify = require("dap.utils").notify
    require("dap.utils").notify = function(msg, log_level)
      if not string.find(msg, "Either the adapter is slow") then
        orig_notify(msg, log_level)
      end
    end

    -- sample keymaps to debug application
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>dd", xcodebuild.build_and_debug, { desc = "Build & Debug" })
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>dr", xcodebuild.debug_without_build, { desc = "Debug Without Building" })
  end,
}
```

| `vim.g.xcodebuild_test_plan`   | Selected Test Plan (ex. MyAppTests)         |

### üß™ Code Coverage

![Xcodebuild Code Coverage](./media/code-coverage.png)
![Xcodebuild Code Coverage Report](./media/coverage-report.png)

Using xcodebuild.nvim you can also check the code coverage after running tests.

1. Make sure that you enabled code coverage for desired targets in your test plan.
2. Enable code coverage in xcodebuild [config](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration):

```lua
code_coverage = {
  enabled = true,
}
```

3. Toggle code coverage `:XcodebuildToggleCodeCoverage` or `:lua require("xcodebuild.actions").toggle_code_coverage(true)`.
4. Run tests - once it's finished, code coverage should appear on the sidebar with line numbers.
5. You can jump between code coverage marks using `:XcodebuildJumpToPrevCoverage` and `:XcodebuildJumpToNextCoverage`.
6. You can also check out the report using `:XcodebuildShowCodeCoverageReport` command.

The plugin sends `XcodebuildCoverageToggled` event that you can use to disable other plugins presenting lines on the side bar (like `gitsigns`). Example:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
  pattern = "XcodebuildCoverageToggled",
  callback = function(event)
    local isOn = event.data
    require("gitsigns").toggle_signs(not isOn)
  end,
})
```

Coverage Report Keys:

| Key              | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `enter` or `tab` | Expand or collapse the current node |
| `o`              | Open source file                    |

‚ö†Ô∏è ¬†From time to time, the code coverage may fail or some targets may be missing (Xcode's bug). Try running tests again then.

‚ö†Ô∏è ¬†If you run tests, modify file and toggle code coverage AFTER that, the placement of marks will be incorrect (because it doesn't know about changes that you made). However, if you show code coverage and after that you modify the code, marks will be moving while you are editing the file.

### üì∏ Snapshot Tests Preview

This plugin offers a nice list of failing snapshot tests. For each test it generates a preview image combining reference, failure, and difference images into one. It works with [swift-snapshot-testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) library.

Run `:XcodebuildFailingSnapshots` to see the list.

If you want to use functions directly instead of user commands, then please see [xcodebuild.actions](./lua/xcodebuild/actions.lua) module.

### üß∞ Troubleshooting

Loading project configuration is a very complex task that relies on parsing multiple crazy outputs from `xcodebuild` commands. Those logs are a pure nightmare to parse. It may not always work. In case of any issues with that, you can try manually providing the configuration by adding `.nvim/xcodebuild/settings.json` file in your root directory.

Sample `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "platform": "iOS",
  "testPlan": "UnitTests",
  "config": "Debug",
  "xcodeproj": "/path/to/project/App.xcodeproj",
  "projectFile": "/path/to/project/App.xcworkspace",
  "projectCommand": "-workspace '/path/to/project/App.xcworkspace'",
  "bundleId": "com.company.bundle-id",
  "destination": "00006000-000C58DC1ED8801E",
  "productName": "App",
  "scheme": "App",
  "appPath": "/Users/YOU/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/App-abafsafasdfasdf/Build/Products/Debug/App.app"
}
```

- `platform` - `macOS` or `iOS`
- `destination` - simulator ID
- `projectFile` / `projectCommand` - can be `xcodeproj` or `xcworkspace`, the main project file that you use
